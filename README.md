Publication link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2022.118658

This code is writted to process crystal orientation measurements.

Method is applied to EBSD maps.

Main runner file is OGRE_FEM.m

The folder directory of the EBSD data must be specified on 5th line of OGRE_FEM.m file.

The finite element related functions are stored in /FE folder.
